<h1>Introduction to explain why we are in the "Aldea" Program</h1>
<p>The need to take care of our immediate natural environment and to become aware of the environmental problems and, especially, of the already noticeable effects of global warming, have led a group of teachers and teachers from the center to start working from an interdisciplinary approach on these issues, within the framework of the Aldea Program of the Junta de Andaluc√≠a. In our project we pursue the involvement of the entire educational community, highlighting the collaboration of the AMPA. Also, the Town Hall of Bollullos par del Condado through the Department of the Environment effectively supports the project.</p>
<h1>Project #SAVE THE OCEAN</h1>
<p>Our Institute has joined the international campaign #savetheocean with a project carried out by the students of 3rd of ESO. The activity consisted of organizing a campaign at the center level to raise the awareness of the entire educational community about the pollution existing in the oceans, especially due to the massive presence of plastics in them, which harms the marine fauna and affects our societies. It is about that from that awareness, each one changes his attitude towards the environment; reducing the consumption of plastics, using paper mills (4 out of 5 plastics that end up in the sea come from land firm) and separating and recycling their waste.</p>
